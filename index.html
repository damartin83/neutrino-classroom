<h2>Particle physics data in your classroom?</h2>

<p>This site provides information and educational materials intended to proved high-school physics students with an in-depth, hands-on interactive experience with real high-energy particle physics. The materials contained inside should be suitable for a 1-2 weeks module on particle physics as it's done by professional scientists.</p>

<p >You can trust us: this project was developed by a collaboration of high school teachers and research physicists using data from the <a href="http://minerva.fnal.gov/">MINERvA</a> experiment.  MINERvA is the name of an experiment at <a href="http://www.fnal.gov"Fermilab</a> that is collecting data on how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino">neutrinos</a> interact with matter. </p>
      <p >The science is real, and it works in the classroom. You don't have to be Einstein to do particle physics!</p>
      <p >Our goal? To show your students how real scientists creatively solve problems and explore the unseen world of fundamental particles. </p>

  <h2>FIXME: Remaining problems on this site.</h2>
  <h3>FIXME: Various things that need editing</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Teacher guide needs a review, possibly an edit.  e.g. Remove italian foods from teacher's guide</li>
    <li>Nathaniel:  Particle sample event doesn't work'</li>
    <li>Nathaniel:  Sample event in muon decay doesn't work.</li>
    <li>move radioactive decay concepts to particle decay page</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>FIXME: Links that existed in the site but that I can't figure out.</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Concepts/Measuring what you cannot see/How do muons and beta rays appear in MINERvA? - NO idea what this is supposed to refer to. No section of the teacher's guide seems appropriate. - remove; redudant with zoo</li>
    <li>Concepts/Decay/"A Measurement of Muon Half Life using CHICOS Particle Detectors", Bob Gates et alia. This document no longer exists, nor does the project website on which it was based.  (Incidentally, I built a 3rd-year undergraduate experiment that measured this for about $400 in equipment. Is this really a useful link in this context?) - Yup, gotta kill this</li>
    <li>Concepts/Minerva in Depth<ul>
      <li>No idea what this is: "Kevin McFarland's Neutrino Talk for Students (ppt)" Neutrinos in the big pictureâ€¦from the Big Bang to the Standard Model</li>
      <li>No idea what this is: "Technical details of the MINERvA detector and beam" Could be the from-birth-to-death? But that's linked elsewhere.</li>
      <li>No idea what this is: "Explore the zoo of neutrino interactions seen in MINERvA so far" Link to the wiki or some such? - send in email from Kevin march 2014</li>    
    </ul></li>
    <li>Relativity and the Mechanics of Muon Decay/Reference on material in special relativity. This was listed as ??? in the original website. Some ideas in page (moved to particle decay page) - Move to Mom'm, but still need</li>
    <li>"Need to develop this activity": Relativity and the Mechanics of Muon Decay/Use Arachne to examine the correlations between speed, momentum and kinetic energy for muons and for protons - move to mom'm, but still need</li>

  </ol>

  <h3>FIXME: Materials that exist but don't seem be linked</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Doc 6564:
      <ol>
        <li>
          "2-Data Mining MINERvA Objectives" - Seems to be a timeline for teachers, not a useful thing for students.  What's it doing here? https://docs.google.com/a/otterbein.edu/file/d/0B-m-2RB4ZIyZWU1Rbm8xZTlMUG8/edit?pli=1
        </li>
        <li>"3-Particle Physics Pre-assessment" Seems to be part of the teacher's guide already.</li>
        <li>"3-Standard MOdel Scavenger Hunt" Seems to be part of the teacher's guide already.</li>
        <li>"6-Quiz: What is MINERvA?" Seems to be part of the teacher's guide already.</li>
        <li>"7-MINERvA Model Lab activity" Already linked to as part of teacher's guide</li>
        <li>"9-Directions for the Simple Arachne website" Already linked to as part of teacher's guide</li>
       </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Doc 5365:<ol>
      <li>"Dice Activity" - already linked to as part of teacher's guide</li>
      <li>"Teacher's Packet" - assume is superseded by doc 6576</li>
      <li>"Decay weblinks" - assume will be replaced by Rik/li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Doc 6576:<ol>
      <li>Contains "MinervaMuonDecayLinks2014". Are these REALLY final?</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>


  <h3>FIXME: Materials that exist but don't seem be linked</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Fix up muon decay for new links. Just put then in the teacher's doc? Or remove them, and make a new html doc linked to from this page? Are the 6576 docs correct?</li>
  </ul>
